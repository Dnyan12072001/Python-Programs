# Operators in Python

# Arithmatic operators : +,- , * , / ,% , **
a = 10
b = 20
print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a/b)
print(a%b)
print(a//b)

#2 Comparision operatres : < > <= >= == !=
a = 100
b = 200
print(a < b)
print(a > b)
print(a == b)
print(a != b)

#3 Identity operators : is , is not
a = 100
b = 100
print(a == b)
print(a is b)
print(a is not b)

l = [1,2,3]
l2 = [1,2,3]
print(a is not b)

#4 Assignment Operators : = , += , -= , *= , /=
a = 200

#5 Bitwise operators : & , | , ^ , >> , <<
a = 2
b = 3
print(bin(a),bin(b))
print(a & b)
print(a | b)
print(a >> b)
print(a << b)

#6 Logical operators : and , or , not
print(10==10 and 20==20)
print(10==30 and 20==20)
print(10==10 or 20==20)
print(10==10 and 80==20)
print(not(20==20))

#7 Membership operators : in , not in
l = [10,20,30,40]
print(20 in l)
print(50 in l)
